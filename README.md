# Convert
The program is designed so you can convert easily between frequency, midi, and note values. 
For instance, if you want to know the note value of a frequency of 1120 hertz, you can use this
program. The program can also convert back a midi value to a frequency value. It's pretty straight
forward. You get the point. 

# Requirements:
