# Convert
The program is designed so you can convert easily between frequency, midi, and note values. 
For instance, if you want to know the note value of a frequency of 1120 hertz or if you have 
a midi value, such as 81, and want to know the frequency. You get the point. 

# Requirements:
Python 2.7
